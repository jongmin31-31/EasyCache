## Event Subscription

You can subscribe to events filtered by event type, code, or source. Subscribing to an event type allows you to receive notifications for all event codes within that category. For more specific alerts, you can refine your subscription by selecting individual event codes and sources. Only project members can be selected as notification recipients. By default, notifications are sent via email; SMS alerts are sent only if a mobile number is registered with a real name.
